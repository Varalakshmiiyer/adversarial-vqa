## Pythia

This repo is forked from [Pythia](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pythia). Pythia is a modular framework for Visual Question Answering research, which formed the basis for the winning entry to the VQA Challenge 2018 from Facebook AI Research (FAIR)â€™s A-STAR team. See their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09956) for more details.
